# Calculator Project

This is yet another project from The Odin Project curriculum, being the last of their "Foundations" path. The purpose of this project is to showcase abilities in Javascript and as well as a bit of CSS by creating a functional calculator that not only functions but also looks like a calculator!

This calculator is relatively simple, and is able to do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as calculating factorial and exponentials of a number; I originally thought that creating a calculator would be easier than it actually was, but there are many different case-scenarios that need to be kept in mind while coding to make sure that the calculator works as intended; this calculator should be working fine as I spent a lot of time fixing bugs and making sure it doesn't break. I first made the HTML and CSS sections of the project, and then moved on to the actual functionality of the calculator, a.k.a the Javascript portion, which was the most time consuming part of the project. The calculator also accepts keyboard input, including numpad characters.

Please keep in mind that the factorial and exponential functions do not work with decimal numbers, and will instead round to the nearest integer. I also made this entire project from scratch and researched very little while developing functions, which means that my code is probably not the very best, but this is meant to be a relatively beginner project so it should be fine, as I also currently have limited experience with Javascript.
